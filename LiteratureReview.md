# POS Tagger for Tunisian Corpus

Compared to English, Arabic has far fewer Natural Language Processing resources
for it. Most of the resources that have been developed are for Modern Standard
Arabic, which is a common written language of all Arab countries but is not 
anyone's native spoken language. The Arabic(s) that are actually used by people in 
their daily lives—the spoken varieties or "dialects"—often have no NLP resources 
at all. Those that do exist are often developed by a small number of committed 
researches, often working on a very limited budget.

The Tunisian Arabic Corpus (McNeil 2019) is an apt example of this kind of
small-scale, under-resourced project. It is a small corpus by international 
standards, yet is one of the largest available for Tunisian Arabic, as well as
one of the few that are publicly accessible and open to all researchers.
